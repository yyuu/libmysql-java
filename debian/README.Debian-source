MySQL Connector/J for Debian
----------------------------

The upstream sources were modified to comply with the Debian Free
Software Guidelines. The following changes were made:

 * The third-party jars in `src/lib' were removed.
 * The two pre-compiled JDBC driver jars (debug and release version)
   were removed.
